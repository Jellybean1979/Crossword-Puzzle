1. **Increase the `gridSize` Constant**: Adjust this to the desired size of your crossword grid. For example, set `gridSize = 15` for a 15x15 grid.

2. **Expand the `words` Array**:
   - Add new entries to the array, specifying:
     - `word`: The actual word (e.g., "BANANA").
     - `direction`: Either `"across"` or `"down"`.
     - `row`: The starting row of the word.
     - `column`: The starting column of the word.
     - `clueNumber`: The corresponding clue number for the grid and clue sections.
     - `clue`: A short description to guide the user in solving the puzzle.

3. **Maintain the Format**: Ensure that all new words follow the same structure in the `words` array.

For instance, if youâ€™re increasing the grid and adding more words, it might look like this:
```javascript
const gridSize = 15;
const words = [
  { word: "APPLE", direction: "across", row: 1, column: 1, clue: "A type of fruit", clueNumber: 1 },
  { word: "ANT", direction: "down", row: 1, column: 1, clue: "A small insect, often with a sting", clueNumber: 1 },
  { word: "PYTHON", direction: "across", row: 7, column: 1, clue: "A programming language", clueNumber: 4 },
  { word: "JAZZ", direction: "across", row: 10, column: 5, clue: "A genre of music", clueNumber: 5 },
  { word: "MOON", direction: "down", row: 5, column: 8, clue: "Earth's natural satellite", clueNumber: 6 },
];
```

4. **Clues Automatically Align**: Because the script dynamically generates the grid and clues based on the `words` array, everything will stay synchronized.

5. **Test Responsiveness**: Once expanded, test how the crossword adapts to screens of various sizes to confirm it still fits beautifully.# Crossword-Puzzle
